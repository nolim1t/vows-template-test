# vows-template-test 

## What
This is a template for doing unit testing, and can be included in any project.

## How

As long as you include the basic libraries, and add in the "test" attribute to "script", it's as simple as doing:

* npm install (to get all the dependencies)
* npm test (to execute the tests in the test folder)
